# Lego motion detection and image classification

This repository contains two main folders of scripts. Firstly, the Computer_files folder contains scripts to create and train an image recognition CNN model for lego technic pieces using Tensorflow (we trained it on Google colab). Secondly, the RPI_files folder contains motion_detection_and_image_classification.py, that when run on RaspberryPi, will detect motion of lego pieces using picamera, extract its bounding box as an image, and pass it through a tensorflowlite model to output its most probable class. The relevant files are found in the respective folders.

The database in this repository contains a small sample size of images. The models in the models folder were trained with 6000 images spanning across 7 possible categories of lego technic. It achieved 93% testing accuracy from an 80/20 split between training and testing data. Graphs of the accuracy and loss across epochs are shown below. A confusion matrix was also plotted to visualize the performance of the classification algorithm. It depicts the count value of true versus false predictions across each category.

More images can be taken by editing the motion_detection_and_image_classification.py script.

The motion detection portion of the RaspberryPi script was adapted from pyimagesearch's project 'Building a Raspberry Pi security camera with OpenCV' and can be found at

Depicted below are 2 examples of lego pieces being classified by the model, through the RaspberryPi's Picamera livestream. When motion counter exceeds 8 consequtive frames, bounding box is extracted and run through model, almost instantaneously outputting the class of lego.
